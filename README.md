# Button Translation Click issue Sample

When a button is in a layout outside of the visible view and then translate into sight it can not be click in Android and iOS.
On Windows it works perfectly fine.

I did not find a workaround so far, I tried enabling disabling the button and also adding the button over code once the view is translared without success.
